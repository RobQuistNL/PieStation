    <h1>Off Canvas Reveal Menu Template</h1>
</div>
<p class="lead">This example demonstrates the use of the offcanvas plugin with a reveal effect.</p>
<p>On the contrary of the push effect, the menu doesn't move with the canvas.</p>
<p>You get the reveal effect by wrapping the content in a div and setting the <code>canvas</code> option to target that div.</p>
<p>Note that in this example, the navmenu doesn't have the <code>offcanvas</code> class, but is placed under the canvas by setting the <code>z-index</code>.</p>
<p>Also take a look at the examples for a navmenu with <a href="../navmenu">slide in effect</a> and <a href="../navmenu-push">push effect</a>.</p>
